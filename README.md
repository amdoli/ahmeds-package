# ahmeds-package
if you want to be smart and everyone likes you even the bitc- don't use my package
# (it's better to use ahmedsWorking_place.py because it has all the funcs and you can run it and after edit it)
# here are the functions in each library and what should it do:
# in AhmedsMath: calc() to use my calculator and if you don't want to use the whole calculator and want simple tasks you can just use thease funcs [add(x,y), subtract(x,y), mult(x,y), div(x,y)]
# in AhmedsCheckInt: checkint(value) the value you insert is being checked if it's an intger returns "True" else "False". || writeint() it's to get the value from the user and check if it's and integer or not
# in AhmedsOS: (here are the real part) navigation(): if you are familier with cd and ls in unix terminal it's kinda the same the program will show you the files and you will choose which file you want to navigate till you say stop || remove() to remove a file || makefile() opp of remove no need to explain || oberation() will ask you what operation you want to do [remove, makefile, listdir, read&write] || ahmedsOs() that's all the prevous funcs combined you gonna understand by type it and see
